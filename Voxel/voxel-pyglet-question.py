Extension of a simple voxel engine originally by Robin Guzniczak 

~~ NOTES ~~
* Maybe pyglet would handy seeing how things are situated in 3D? , Note that pyglet is not limited to voxels! It is a general OpenGL wrapper!
* Voxel Engine , C++ & Python: http://bytebash.com/tag/pyglet/

~~ TODO ~~
[ ] Interactive camera , Fly
    [X] Simplest kb interaction to move camera
    [ ] Sensible camera flight , such that the camera focus is a direction rather than a point , consider Vector3D!
    [ ] Rotate camera with mouse
    [ ] Hold arrow keys to keep flying
[ ] Add FPS , position , and other metrics to the screen
[ ] Fix the drawing order of the voxels
[ ] Optimization I
    [ ] Backface culling , calc normals from edges and store # glEnable(GL_CULL_FACE) 
        # http://nullege.com/codes/show/src@p@r@Printrun-HEAD@printrun@stlview.py/119/pyglet.gl.GL_CULL_FACE
    [ ] Interior voxel culling , Use Voxelyze as an example , This should only update if voxels are changed and not change with the view
    [ ] Visible frustum , There is a LOT of research on doing this quickly , probably take advantage of voxel setting and test by voxel centers , easy?
[ ] Interactive camera , Walk
[ ] Generate terrain

			There is a significant overhead in using pyglet.graphics.draw and pyglet.graphics.draw_indexed due to pyglet 
			interpreting and formatting the vertex data for the video device. Usually the data drawn in each frame (of an animation) 
			is identical or very similar to the previous frame, so this overhead is unnecessarily repeated.

			A VertexList is a list of vertices and their attributes, stored in an efficient manner thatâ€™s suitable for direct 
			upload to the video card. On newer video cards (supporting OpenGL 1.5 or later) the data is actually stored in video memory.
